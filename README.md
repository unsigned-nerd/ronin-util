My [Ronin](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Ronin) Utilities

Ronin is a Lisp-based and fun-to-use image processing tool.  Its GitHub
repo is here: [https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Ronin](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Ronin)

# Why do I use Ronin?

My common image editing tasks are:

  - drawing an arrow to mark a point on an image and send it to another
    person to tell him/her what I want them to look at
  - drawing a square to mark an area on an image and send it to another
    person to tell him/her what I want them to look at
  - cropping an image before sending it to other people

I had been using ImageMagick for many years.  It's really not fun to
use, especially when my tasks are really so trivial.

Ronin is what I had been longing for.  Plain, simple and
developer-friendly.
